# JavaScript Quiz

## Description
I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions that features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript and stores high scores in local storage.  

GitHub repository: https://github.com/espinbrandon49/javaScriptQuiz

Deployed Link: https://espinbrandon49.github.io/javaScriptQuiz/

## Installation
Runs in the browser
Git clone - git@github.com:espinbrandon49/javaScriptQuiz.git

## Tools
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, Chrome DevTools

### JavaScript
The JavaScript for this quiz can be described in context of how I used the Web API to extend the functionality of the browser.

* I stored and retrieved data (high scores list) using local storage.

* Document Object Model connects the HTML to my JavaScript by:
  - using event handlers for document click events
  - accessing the HTML elements via the DOM
  - accessing and manipulating form data, HTML, element values, element attributes, and computed/defined styling to dynamically receive input, render outputs, and store information

* Used console extensively to: 
  - diagnose problems with my JavaScript
  - view the results of my functions before I inserted into the application.
  - ensure my code is executing in the right order by inspecting the variables in console at certain moments of time
 
### HTML
* The source code uses semantic HTML elements.
* The structure of the HTML elements follow a logical structure that is key for DOM references, styling, and access to the elements from JS and CSS. 
* The HTML follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, etc. so that I was able to:
 - concisely use the Document interfaces such as getElementById() in JavaScript to access the inputs/element data, display accurate outputs, and connect event handlers.
* The HTML is referenced throughout the JS and CSS using the Web API .

### CSS
* The application has responsive layout that adapts to your viewport on various screen sizes
* Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.
* Application user interface style is clean and polished.

## Git/GitHub
* The Application is deployed at a live URL and loads with no errors.
* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
* Repository commit messages allow one to follow along as the application development story unfolds.
* Repository contains quality readme with description, screenshot, link to deployed application.
* GitHub repository contains application code.

## Chrome DevTools
* Used console to diagnose problems with my JavaScript.
* Used console to view the results of all of my functions to see that they were doing what I expected and holistically.
* Using DevTools, I viewed my media queries and application on different device screens and to inspect various elements in the Elements panel.
* Used DevTools to examine my box sizes, padding, borders, content, etc., and to view element styles in the browser.
